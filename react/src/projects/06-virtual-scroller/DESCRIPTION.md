# Virtual Scroller Dropdown

## Difficulty: Hard

## Description

Build a high-performance dropdown component that can efficiently handle large datasets using virtual scrolling. The dropdown should display a list of 200K+ items without performance issues, allowing users to select a single value that appears below the dropdown.

## Requirements

- Create a dropdown component that can handle 200K+ data points efficiently using virtual scrolling to add and remove items from the DOM, maintaining smooth scrolling performance with large datasets.

## Notes

- Change the number in the API to increasingly large numbers as you test the feature. If you do it right away with the non-virtualized solution, the number of DOM elements could be so big as to crash your tab or browser.
