# Counter Challenge

## Difficulty: Easy

## Description
Create a simple counter component that allows users to increment a number and reset it back to zero. This is a fundamental React challenge that tests your understanding of state management and event handling.

## Requirements

- Display a counter that starts at 0
- Add an "increment" button that increases the counter by 1 when clicked
- Add a "reset" button that sets the counter back to 0 when clicked
- Use React hooks for state management
- Handle click events properly
- The counter should update in real-time when buttons are clicked
