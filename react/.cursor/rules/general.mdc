# React Tech Interview Prep

## Project Overview
This is a React practice environment for technical interview preparation. Each project is a self-contained coding challenge that tests specific React concepts and skills.

## Project Structure
- `src/projects/` - Individual React coding challenges
- Each project folder contains: `App.tsx`, `App.css`, and `DESCRIPTION.md`
- Switch between projects by changing the import in `src/main.tsx`

## Creating New Challenges

### 1. Project Setup
- Create a new folder in `src/projects/`
- Add `App.tsx` with basic component structure
- Add `App.css` with styling
- Import CSS in `App.tsx`: `import './App.css'`

### 2. DESCRIPTION.md Format
```
# [Challenge Name]

## Difficulty: [Easy/Medium/Hard/Expert]

## Description
[Brief explanation of what to build]

## Requirements
- [Specific requirement 1]
- [Specific requirement 2]
- [Specific requirement 3]
```

### 3. Implementation Guidelines
- **Leave space for implementation**: Remove core logic, keep UI structure and layout
- **Static values**: Use placeholder values instead of dynamic data
- **Non-functional elements**: Keep UI components but remove event handlers and logic
- **Import structure**: Keep necessary imports but remove unused ones
- **Component structure**: Maintain the visual layout and styling

### 4. Challenge Difficulty Levels
- **Easy**: Basic state management, simple event handling
- **Medium**: Complex state, multiple components, form handling
- **Hard**: Advanced patterns, custom hooks, complex logic
- **Expert**: Performance optimization, advanced React patterns

## Best Practices
- Keep challenges focused on specific React concepts
- Provide clear, actionable requirements
- Test the challenge yourself before finalizing
- Ensure the starting code compiles and renders
